P3-S1-obsidian-ui-prototype

Goal:
1. Review all backend API endpoints, docs, sample payloads; confirm mapping for Obsidian workflow integration.
2. Design minimal workflow prototype (Markdown note schema, dataview query, Obsidian plugin scaffold) to connect live backend.
3. Build Obsidian input/report note template and test API automation for “add transaction”, “run report”, etc.
4. Simulator: Test scripts to push/pull transaction data between Obsidian and backend API.
5. Document findings, example scripts, and recommended integration architecture in `docs/obsidian-integration-guide.md`.
