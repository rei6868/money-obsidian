# Subscription Domain Schemas

The subscription domain tracks recurring services and the people enrolled in them. These tables are designed to feed future automation that generates monthly charges per member and keeps accountabilities clear across the household.

## Drizzle ORM Definitions

```ts
import {
  subscriptions,
  subscriptionMembers,
} from "@/db/schema/subscriptions";
```

See [`src/db/schema/subscriptions.ts`](../src/db/schema/subscriptions.ts) for the full implementation and inline commentary.

> **Note:** Google Sheet integrations now live in [`sheetLinks.ts`](../src/db/schema/sheetLinks.ts) and are documented separately
> in [`sheet-link-schema.md`](./sheet-link-schema.md).

## `subscriptions` Table

| Field | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `subscriptionId` | `varchar(36)` | ✅ | Primary key for the subscription (typically UUID) that downstream jobs and members reference. | `sub_6bb448f3` |
| `name` | `varchar(180)` | ✅ | Display name shown in dashboards, invoices, and notifications. | `YouTube Premium Family` |
| `type` | `subscription_type` enum | ✅ | Categorises the subscription for analytics; values include `youtube`, `icloud`, `spotify`, `netflix`, `other`. | `youtube` |
| `pricePerMonth` | `numeric(12,2)` | ✅ | Total monthly recurring cost in the platform's base currency. | `299000.00` |
| `imgUrl` | `text` | ⛔️ (optional) | CDN-hosted icon or illustration rendered on subscription cards. | `https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/youtube.png` |
| `ownerId` | `varchar(36)` FK → `people.person_id` | ✅ | Person responsible for managing the subscription contract and default charge allocation. | `person_123` |
| `status` | `subscription_status` enum | ✅ | Lifecycle flag controlling invoicing behaviour (`active`, `paused`, `cancelled`). | `active` |
| `createdAt` | `timestamptz` (default `now()`) | ✅ | When the subscription was registered; useful for onboarding audits. | `2024-03-01T00:05:00Z` |
| `updatedAt` | `timestamptz` (default `now()`) | ✅ | Tracks the last configuration change so recalculation jobs can react. | `2024-03-15T09:12:33Z` |

**Design notes**
- Enums keep downstream analytics consistent while remaining extensible.
- `ownerId` lets automation attribute default payments and creates a starting `subscriptionMembers` record during onboarding.

## `subscription_members` Table

| Field | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `memberId` | `varchar(36)` | ✅ | Primary key for the membership row (UUID). | `submem_01` |
| `subscriptionId` | `varchar(36)` FK → `subscriptions.subscription_id` | ✅ | Links the member back to the parent subscription. | `sub_6bb448f3` |
| `personId` | `varchar(36)` FK → `people.person_id` | ✅ | Identifies the enrolled person. | `person_123` |
| `role` | `subscription_member_role` enum | ✅ | Distinguishes administrators (`owner`) from regular consumers (`member`). | `member` |
| `joinDate` | `date` | ✅ | When the person joined, used for prorating invoices. | `2024-03-10` |
| `leaveDate` | `date` | ⛔️ (optional) | When populated, indicates the member stopped participating so charges cease. | `2024-05-01` |
| `shareRatio` | `numeric(5,4)` | ⛔️ (optional) | Explicit cost split for this member (`0.25` = 25%); `null` means runtime equal split logic. | `0.3333` |
| `status` | `subscription_member_status` enum | ✅ | Indicates whether to keep generating charges (`active` or `left`). | `active` |
| `notes` | `text` | ⛔️ (optional) | Free-form annotations that capture manual adjustments or context for finance reviews. | `Prorated for April` |
| `createdAt` | `timestamptz` (default `now()`) | ✅ | Membership creation timestamp for historical audits. | `2024-03-10T12:00:00Z` |
| `updatedAt` | `timestamptz` (default `now()`) | ✅ | Tracks the last membership update (role/status changes). | `2024-04-01T08:30:00Z` |

**Design notes**
- A unique index prevents duplicate person/subscription combinations.
- A check constraint ensures `shareRatio` stays between `0` and `1`, paving the way for accurate charge allocation logic.

### Automation Considerations

- **Monthly billing:** The combination of `subscriptions.pricePerMonth`, `subscriptionMembers.shareRatio`, and `subscriptionMembers.status` provides enough data for cronjobs to calculate per-person charges.
